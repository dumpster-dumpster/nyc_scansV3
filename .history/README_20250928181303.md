# WebGL Gaussian Splat Viewer (Vite)

This project is a Vite-powered web application for viewing 3D Gaussian splats. It is a migration of the original static HTML/JS viewer to the Vite framework for improved development experience and performance.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local server URL (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## PLY File Processing (NEW)

This project now uses **pre-cropped splat files** for better performance. Instead of cropping files on-the-fly, use the Python script to crop them ahead of time:

### Quick Setup
1. Place your original PLY files in `original_splats/`
2. Run the cropping script:
   ```bash
   python crop_ply_files.py
   ```
   Or use the batch script:
   ```bash
   ./process_splats.sh
   ```
3. Cropped files will be saved to `public/splats/` for hosting

### Benefits
- âš¡ **Faster loading** - Smaller files load much quicker
- ðŸ“‰ **Reduced bandwidth** - Less data to transfer  
- ðŸš€ **Better performance** - No client-side cropping overhead
- ðŸŽ¯ **Consistent results** - Same crop bounds applied to all files

For detailed instructions, see [SPLAT_PROCESSING.md](./SPLAT_PROCESSING.md)

## Features
- Mouse, keyboard, touch, and gamepad controls for navigation
- Drag-and-drop support for .ply and cameras.json files
- Animated loading spinner and camera info display
- Optimized for pre-cropped splat files

## Project Structure
- `index.html` â€“ Main HTML entry point
- `src/main.js` â€“ Main JavaScript logic
- `crop_ply_files.py` â€“ Python script for cropping PLY files
- `original_splats/` â€“ Directory for original PLY files
- `public/splats/` â€“ Directory for processed/cropped PLY files

## Notes
- All original UI and controls are preserved from the static version
- Cropping logic has been moved from JavaScript to Python for better performance
- For further customization, edit `src/main.js` and `index.html`
